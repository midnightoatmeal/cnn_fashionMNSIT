# FashionMNIST CNN Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify grayscale clothing images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The model is trained from scratch, achieving solid performance on the test set.

## Features
- FashionMNIST dataset loading and preprocessing  
- CNN architecture built using `nn.Sequential`  
- Model training over multiple epochs  
- Evaluation with accuracy tracking  
- Visualization of training loss and model predictions
- Plotted a confusion matrix

## Results
Final accuracy score: 88.5%
